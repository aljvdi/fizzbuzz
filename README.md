## Main Aim
The main aim of this challenge is learning basic algorithm that machine can process


For example, if the program is run with `n = 15`, the output should be:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

Fizz Buzz is often used as a way to assess a programmer's ability to think logically and write clean, efficient code. It can also be used as a way to introduce basic programming concepts, such as loops and conditional statements.

## Summary
In summary, Fizz Buzz is a simple programming problem that involves printing numbers from 1 to n and replacing multiples of three with "Fizz", multiples of five with "Buzz", and multiples of both three and five with "FizzBuzz".
